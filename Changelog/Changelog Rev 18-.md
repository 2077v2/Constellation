NOTE This will be the last time you need to replace this file upon an update.

REMEMBER TO REMOVE OLD MODS WHEN ASKED IN VORTEX!!!

- Fixed Reshade location
- Fixed DLSS location
- Added a custom Constellation loader that enables me to update the StarfieldCustom.ini on each update. This means you wont have to replace the StarfieldCustom ini on specific updates of the collection.
