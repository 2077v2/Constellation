## [HEY GUYS Rev 28 is COMING SOON](https://)

## NOTES

MAKE SURE TO REMOVE OLD MODS WHEN ASKED IN VORTEX

- If you are unable to open doors and hatches Disable the following Mods Vortex
- [Faster Airlock and Hatch Animations](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/2489?tab=description)
- [Faster Furniture Animations - Sitting - Workbenches - Cockpits](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/2645)
- [Faster Ship Animations - Taking Off - Landing - Docking](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/2815)

First installation is now easier. Collection doesnt require inputting the "bat ConstellationLoader" starting command. We are now using CCR Console Command Runner.

- Fixed DLSS Mod that was set to required instead of optional.
- Message for onedrive users. With the new Vortex extension you may have noticed onedrive is now trying to backup your Data folder in your Documents. I dont use onedrive so im unsure of a fix. If you dont use onedrive make sure to turn of syncing.
- Bethini intergration in Vortex now makes it easier. To use the tool.
