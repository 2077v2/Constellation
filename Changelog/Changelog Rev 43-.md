## HOW TO UPDATE

**1**) Create a new Profile in Vortex and enable it.

**2**) Go to the [Collection](https://next.nexusmods.com/starfield/collections/npk3lv?utm_source=copy&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=share_collection) page and ensure the most current revision number is displayed, then select select **"ADD TO VORTEX"**

**3**) When prompted to select which profile to install to, select the new profile you created in Step 1

**4**) Once the update is downloaded you can remove the old profile.

**NOTE** Don't worry you will **NOT** have to redownload the entire collection with this method.
