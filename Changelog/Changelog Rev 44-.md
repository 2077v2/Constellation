## [HEY GUYS Rev 44 is HERE](https://)


## HOW TO UPDATE

**1**) Create a new Profile in Vortex and enable it.

**2**) Go to the [Collection](https://next.nexusmods.com/starfield/collections/npk3lv?utm_source=copy&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=share_collection) page and ensure the most current revision number is displayed, then select select **"ADD TO VORTEX"**

**3**) When prompted to select which profile to install to, select the new profile you created in Step 1

**4**) Once the update is downloaded you can remove the old profile.

**NOTE** Don't worry you will **NOT** have to redownload the entire collection with this method.

## NOTES


## Changes

We have had some feedback about the Fomod installers that pop-up when downloading the collection. We have removed some of the pop-up by selecting a balanced prest in each Mod. If you would like to change this you can right click on the mod in Vortex and select "Reinstall" here you will be able to choose your preset.
