## [HEY GUYS Rev 47 is HERE](https://)

## HOW TO UPDATE

**1**) Create a new Profile in Vortex and enable it.

**2**) Go to the [Collection](https://next.nexusmods.com/starfield/collections/npk3lv?utm_source=copy\&utm_medium=social\&utm_campaign=share_collection) page and ensure the most current revision number is displayed, then select **"ADD TO VORTEX"**

**3**) When prompted to select which profile to install to, select the new profile you created in Step 1

**4**) Once the update is downloaded you can remove the old profile.

**NOTE** Don't worry you will **NOT** have to redownload the entire collection with this method.

## NOTES

STAR WARS USERS MAKE SURE YOU UPDATE BOTH PACKS. IGNORE VORTEX ERRORS UNTIL YOU HAVE DONE SO

- Vortex now has a plugin manager built in please check the guide on the collection page.
- This update requires you to run the Plugins Manager from Vortex and select the new ESM Mods that have been added.
- We have removed some of the loose file textures and replaced them with a diffrent file version. This will increase performance on all systems. We currently have a bug preventing some of the textures from applying and we should have a fix out soon.


### Changes

- After the update you may see a notification in Vortex for depreciated Fomods all you have to do is select "FIX".
