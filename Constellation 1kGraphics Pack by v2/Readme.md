### Collection Rev 4

![](https://s11.gifyu.com/images/Sgdn9.jpg)Hey, Guys [v2](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/123334373) here this is The Constellation Performance Texture Pack for **Starfield**.

###

## A message from [XilaMonstrr](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/users/126616023)

**ABOUT ME**\
I have [released over 250 mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/126616023?tab=user+files), nearly all texture optimization or upscaling for Skyrim and Cyberpunk 2077, including [Performance Optimized Textures for all of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/68055). My work has been featured in a number of gaming magazines over the past two years.
I have been eagerly awaiting the release of Starfield FOR.EV.ER, and the main reason for the delayed release of this mod is because I am absolutely in love with this game and having trouble pulling away from playing it.
That said, there's a ton of work to do on the textures so I am also incredibly excited to get to work on the vanilla game textures and improve user experiences with performance and visual quality. Please track my mods from my user page to stay tuned to new releases.\

You can find me in [v2's Starfield discord here](https://discord.gg/v2-s-collections-1076179431195955290).

## FAQ

<details><summary>COMMON FAQS</summary>
### COMMON FAQS

**Which pack should I choose?**\
Completely depends on your system. My guess is that if you have a 2080 or better the 1K pack will probably be enough. If you have a 1060 or below you might need the Quarter Resolution Pack.\
\
**Why loose files?**\
I am sticking with loose files until Stage 4 of this project. This will allow files to be more easily overwritten by both other mods and by any fixes or updates.\
\
**Why is it SO large?**\
This mod contains over 41,000 texture files, with an original uncompressed size of 64GB.\
\
**Why won't you update the AIO pack at each stage?**\
The files are too large, I want to verify that there aren't issues at every stage of the process, and you can always overwrite this mod with the new releases.\
\
**I'm having a bug or other problem with this mod, what do I do?**\
Please report it on the 'Bugs' tab on this mod page. I may not be able to keep up with all the comments on the 'Posts' tab.\
\
**Why did you downscale color maps?**\
For Skyrim I often will leave color/diffuse maps in higher resolution than other texture types. I've found that with Starfield (like CP77), the quality of the normal maps can have as much effect on the image quality as the color maps. Ultimately this is something that really depends on the type of object the texture is of. For example, skins often have minimal detail on their color maps and the minute texturing of the normals can bring the color to life far more. Much of my attention for upscaling this game will be on the normal maps.\
\
**How does this differ from *****x***** mod?**\
Read everything above and if it isn't clear, ask a friend or post in the comments. Likely answers are that it downscales more textures or is packaged differently.
