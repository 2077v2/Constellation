## A message from [XilaMonstrr](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/users/126616023)

**ABOUT ME**\
I have [released over 250 mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/126616023?tab=user+files), nearly all texture optimization or upscaling for Skyrim and Cyberpunk 2077, including [Performance Optimized Textures for all of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/68055). My work has been featured in a number of gaming magazines over the past two years.
I have been eagerly awaiting the release of Starfield FOR.EV.ER, and the main reason for the delayed release of this mod is because I am absolutely in love with this game and having trouble pulling away from playing it.
That said, there's a ton of work to do on the textures so I am also incredibly excited to get to work on the vanilla game textures and improve user experiences with performance and visual quality. Please track my mods from my user page to stay tuned to new releases.\
\
You can find me in [v2's Starfield discord here](https://discord.gg/v2-s-collections-1076179431195955290).

## FAQ

<details><summary>COMMON FAQS</summary>
[Is this compatible with *x* mod?](https://)\
These are just textures, so they are easily overwritten by other mods or vice versa. Loose files will always overwrite BA2 archives.\
\
[Why single mods instead of an AIO?](https://)\
I do plan to release some AIO mods later, but I want to be able to address bugs and make improvements at each stage of this project and also allow users to pick and choose which textures they want to improve based on their gameplay and personal preferences.\
\
[I'm having a bug or other problem with this mod, what do I do?](https://)\
Please report it on the 'Bugs' tab on this mod page. I may not be able to keep up with all the comments on the 'Posts' tab.\
\
[How does this differ from *x* mod?](https://)\
I can't say for sure, but one of the main differences between my upscales and others are that I spend a great deal of time testing different interpolations (mixtures) of AI-generated models for the best combination for each type of texture map and each type of object that I'm upscaling. Even with my years of experience, I may run 8 different tests on one texture file before moving forward.
There are programs out there that are fully led by AI software and will just take an image and do all the work for you. Those will never produce as good of results. Of course, detailed hand work is still superior when available, but far more time-consuming. I do what I can and it's way better than vanilla.
In addition, I always provide a variety of resolution options for users to choose from so that they aren't forced into whatever I decide to be the best.
