## A message from [XilaMonstrr](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/users/126616023)

**ABOUT ME**\
I have [released over 250 mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/126616023?tab=user+files), nearly all texture optimization or upscaling for Skyrim and Cyberpunk 2077, including [Performance Optimized Textures for all of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/68055). My work has been featured in a number of gaming magazines over the past two years.
I have been eagerly awaiting the release of Starfield FOR.EV.ER, and the main reason for the delayed release of this mod is because I am absolutely in love with this game and having trouble pulling away from playing it.
That said, there's a ton of work to do on the textures so I am also incredibly excited to get to work on the vanilla game textures and improve user experiences with performance and visual quality. Please track my mods from my user page to stay tuned to new releases.\
\
You can find me in [v2's Starfield discord here](https://discord.gg/v2-s-collections-1076179431195955290).
