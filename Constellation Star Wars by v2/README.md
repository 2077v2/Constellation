![](https://s6.gifyu.com/images/S4ATa.jpg)Hey, Guys [v2](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/123334373) here this is [CONSTELLATION Star Wars ](https://)for **Starfield**.

<details><summary>ABOUT ME</summary>
Hey Chooms! My name is [v2](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/123334373) and i'm excited to meet you! I've fallen in love with Gaming and Modding and I'm sure you have too. Modding is really a cool way to add so much more to the games we already enjoy. But it's not always easy to get all those cool mods to work together with no issues. This inspired me to combine my passion for helping people, with a desire to make games that use mods, work as seamlessly as they can. I want it to be easier for you to jump right in, without having to worry if the mods will work. I curated a collection for [Hogwarts Legacy](https://next.nexusmods.com/hogwartslegacy/collections/uehwil?utm_source=copy\&utm_medium=social\&utm_campaign=share_collection) for example, and that has been the most endorsed and downloaded collection on Nexus! My [Cyberpunk 2077](https://next.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/collections/dfvt7o?utm_source=copy\&utm_medium=social\&utm_campaign=share_collection) collection is one of the most diversely comprehensive mod collections to date. Whether you love [Cyberpunk](https://next.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/collections/dfvt7o?utm_source=copy\&utm_medium=social\&utm_campaign=share_collection), [Starfield](https://next.nexusmods.com/starfield/collections/npk3lv?utm_source=copy\&utm_medium=social\&utm_campaign=share_collection), or even [Hogwarts Legacy](https://next.nexusmods.com/hogwartslegacy/collections/uehwil?utm_source=copy\&utm_medium=social\&utm_campaign=share_collection), I've got your back. And so does the community we've grown in my [Discord](https://discord.gg/xZNztPjA2u) when you have questions or just want to hangout with other like-minded gamers who want to get the most out of their games too!
