<summary>PC Optimizations</summary>

![img](https://s11.gifyu.com/images/Sgd38.jpg)

I've been building Pcs for a few years now and have picked up a few tips and tricks along the way. You can also check out my builds on our Discord.

I can connect to your Pc via a remote connection [Team Viewer]() and optimize your Pc for gaming. 

I use a few tools and methods which I will explain here. These tools/programs are lightweight and will not take up many resources in the background. These tools are used widely by the Pc community and are well known.

All links to these tools will be listed below so you can check them out for yourself.

All of this I offer free of charge. The only thing I ask is for you to **Endorse** and support our collections. It really means a lot to us.


### MSI afterburner

This is an overclocking tool but it does much more. With this tool, I can set the following.

- Custom fan curve this will help with **GPU** temps.

- Unlock the voltage control on the **GPU** this helps maintain higher clock speeds for the **GPU**.



### RTSS Riva Statistics Tuner

This is a hardware monitoring tool that works alongside **MSI Afterburner**.

1) This allows monitoring of all **GPU** parameters including an **FPS** counter, Temp readings, **FPS** cap and much much more



### ISLC Intelligent Standby List Cleaner

This help to clear out the standby list in Windows in turn freeing up Memory **RAM** the benefits of this tool are fewer stutters in game and maintaining a steady fps.



### Quick CPU

Quick CPU is a program that was designed to fine-tune and monitor important CPU and System parameters such as **CPU** Temperature (Package and Core Temp), **CPU** Performance, Power, Voltage, Current, Core Parking, Frequency Scaling, System Memory, Turbo Boost, C-States, Speed Shift FIVR Control as well as making other adjustments.


### CPU Z & GPU z

These will allow you to identify the GPU and CPU.


### GEEK Uninstaller

This is a great tool for uninstalling programs and removing any traces they leave behind.


### WINDOWS OPTIMIZATION

As well as the tools i can install and configure there are also some optimizations I can perform inside of Windows itself.

These include.

- Nvidia control panel optimizations

- Bios optimizations.

- Power management optimizations.

- Game-specific optimizations.



### OVERCLOCKING OF THE GPU

I can overclock and stress test your **GPU**.



### As well as all of the above I can.

- Run system scans to ensure everything is running as it should be and repair errors.
