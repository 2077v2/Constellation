## Make a Backup Save

- Mods for Bethesda games can be unreliable at times it's always good to make a backup of your save file. The save file location can be found below Just copy the contents of this file and place it somewhere on your PC.

```
C:\Users\[YOUR USERNAME]\Documents\My Games\Starfield\Saves
```

**3**) When prompted to select which profile to install to, select the new profile you created in Step 1

**4**) Once the update is downloaded you can remove the old profile.

## ![](https://s11.gifyu.com/images/SgdAq.png)[READ](https://)

- ⛔ It Is important that you READ the following Installation guide to fully understand everything clearly. It is a simple step-by-step guide.

## Install time

This is a large collection I recommend purchasing a Nexus premium account even just for 1 month to install the collection it will make installation much easier. And you can just cancel the subscription after the installation if you wish.

**Premium Users**: Takes 15 Min + Semi-automatic. You can be AFK with a few Install menus at the end of the installation.\
**Free Users:** Takes 30 Min + Semi-automatic. You will have to click on download for each mod one by one.
