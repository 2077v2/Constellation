⛔  If you want to use the Reshade Make sure to install and configure the Reshade before enabling the optional DLSS Mod.

⛔ You will need to download the DLSS update file linked [HERE](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/nvidia-dlss-dll/) (nvngx\_dlss\_2.5.1.zip)

```
mods/UpscalerBasePlugin folder.
```

⛔This mod can be buggy with a Reshade installed and Overlays. I personally wouldn't use it but if you see a performance increase then go for it. If you have any bugs disable the 2 mods in Vortex.
