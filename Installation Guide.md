### [DLSS](https://)

⛔ You will need to download the DLSS update file linked [HERE](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/nvidia-dlss-dll/) (nvngx\_dlss\_2.5.1.zip)

1\) Enable these 2 Mods in Vortex

![](https://s11.gifyu.com/images/SgP0C.png)2) You need to place the nvngx\_dlss.dll file you downloaded into.

```
mods/UpscalerBasePlugin folder.
```

3\) Go to the "SETTINGS" menu and on the DISPLAY tab enable "FSR2" as shown in the picture below.\
![](https://s11.gifyu.com/images/SgFWA.png)4) To bring up the menu for DLSS hit the (END) key. Here you can choose from DLSS or XeSS.

5\) Go to the "SETTINGS" menu on the "DISPLAY" tab you can change the "RENDER RESOLUTION SCALE" the lower the setting the more FPS but Less visual quality.

\
⛔This mod can be buggy with a Reshade installed and Overlays. I personally wouldn't use it but if you see a performance increase then go for it. If you have any bugs disable the 2 mods in Vortex.
