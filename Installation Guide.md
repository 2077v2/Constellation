## Make a Backup Save

- Mods for Bethesda games can be unreliable at times it's always good to make a backup of your save file. The save file location can be found below Just copy the contents of this file and place it somewhere on your PC.

```
C:\Users\[YOUR USERNAME]\Documents\My Games\Starfield\Saves
```

## [Make a Backup of your Game Files](https://) (OPTIONAL)

- If you would like to backup your unmodded game files you can use my tool [HERE](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/1064). Note you will need an extra 120gb of space on the drive where Starfield is installed.

- ⛔ It Is important that you READ the following Installation guide to fully understand everything clearly. It is a simple step-by-step guide.

## Install time

This is a large collection I recommend purchasing a Nexus premium account even just for 1 month to install the collection it will make installation much easier. And you can just cancel the subscription after the installation if you wish.

**Premium Users**: Takes 15 Min + Semi-automatic. You can be AFK with a few Install menus at the end of the installation.\
**Free Users:** Takes 30 Min + Semi-automatic. You will have to click on download for each mod one by one.
