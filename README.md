![](https://s11.gifyu.com/images/S4CUN.jpg)Hey, Guys [v2](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/123334373) here this is [Constellation](https://) for **Starfield**.

<details><summary>ABOUT ME</summary>
Hey Chooms! This is a little bit about me and why I started curating mod collections

Back in the 90s, I was a young kid, and I never slowed down for more than two seconds.&#x20;

But this all changed one day when I visited my cousin he had a Super Nintendo!!! and I fell in love, from that moment on I knew gaming was something that called out to me.

So when my parents bought my sister and i our own console (Playstation) I was over the moon, long nights playing Crash Bandicoot, Spyro and Gran Turismo you can't beat these memories.

Skip forward 10 years and games like Red Dead Redemption, GTA Vice City and Need for Speed these games only solidified my love of gaming even more. Like many of us, it gave us a way to escape and let our imagination run wild.

Skip forward to the current day. The time when we can create new experiences in the games that we already love what could be better than this? Modding is really a cool way to add so much more. But it's not always easy to get all those cool mods to work together with no issues. This inspired me to combine my passion for helping people, with a desire to make games that use mods and work as seamlessly as they can.

So join us choombah and come along for the ride.

<details><summary>MY VISION FOR THIS COLLECTION</summary>
This isn't just a mod list we have slapped together this is a whole new world of **Starfield** with hundreds of hours spent building, configuring, modding, and testing to create the best **Starfield** experience possible.

My Vision for all my Collections is for you to be able to play the game any way you want. I won't force you to play a certain way I want you to have the tools to create your own experience so you can get the most out of your game.\
\
Constellation is the Ultimate experience you have access to everything you could ever need or want. Whether it's taking screenshots in photo mode, playing the most extreme difficulty, or cheating your way through Starfield this collection has it all and I mean all.\
\
And that's it I hope to see you in the Cosmos but now it's time for me to go.

### [Starfield Community Patch](https://)

The Starfield Community Patch (SFCP) project is a collective effort by mod authors and the wider player community of Starfield to fix bugs, errors and other inconsistencies present in the game. This includes tweaks, typos and other changes that may have been missed (or not yet released) by the developers. The overall goal is to improve the vanilla experience for all players. All fixes should be considered unofficial unless the change is carried forward by Bethesda.

Fixes included in the patch are intended to correct bugs or errors in the base game, examples include:

- Misplaced objects
- Script errors
- Inconsistencies in item properties
- Faulty missions/quests
- Game-breaking exploits
- Missing attributes (such as tags, header flags, etc.)
- Spelling errors

## Proper Gravity Wave Power

![](https://s10.gifyu.com/images/StK5D.png)[Proper Gravity Wave Power](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/8566?tab=description) by [Deebz96](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/users/15339119)

## Features

> Turns Gravity Wave into a proper “force push” power, using ragdoll physics instead of the vanilla knockdown animations. Designed to be fair and balanced.

<details><summary>View content</summary>
## [ Features](https://)

- No more knockdown animations. Just pure, proper ragdoll physics. This is a change across the entire game, but you will notice it the most with this power.
- Magnitude and cost now scale with the power’s level. It will be significantly more powerful, and cheaper to cast, at higher levels. This is balanced with other vanilla powers.
- Increases fall damage for NPCs while they are rag-dolled by this power specifically so that it is actually possible to kill them by blasting them off of a high enough surface.
- Small improvements and fixes to the existing aspects of the power.

## [Ragdoll Knockdowns](https://)

The most important thing this mod does is disable the knockdown animations on humans, robots, and aliens. This allows for them to simply be ragdolled when they are knocked down. Not only does this look better, but it allows this power to actually “force push” an enemy away.\
\
This is a sweeping change across the entire game, but don’t worry. I have checked other sources of knockdowns, such as fuel tank explosions, and they look fine without any adjustments.\
\
The vanilla animations also only had "fall forwards" and "fall backward" versions, which means that hits from the side looked *entirely* wrong.

## ![](https://i.ibb.co/qWXVMP2/animation-vs-ragdoll-sideways.gif)[Magnitude and Cost](https://)

At level 1, this power will feel equivalent to vanilla. You will be able to knock enemies down, and might knock them off a nearby ledge, but you won’t be sending them flying.\
\
Magnitude will very slowly increase with each level, with a noticeable increase at level 5. Then another slow crawl up to levels 9 and 10, where it once again becomes noticeably more powerful.\
\
At level 10, it will be as powerful as a full Unrelenting Force shout from Skyrim. No really, I’m actually using the same magnitude value of 15 used by that shout. On a 1.0 G world, it looks pretty much the same as it did in that game. On lower G worlds, well… use it responsibly.

![](https://i.ibb.co/ck57QrC/animation-vs-ragdoll-level1.gif)![](https://i.ibb.co/dfjcm0d/animation-vs-ragdoll-level10.gif)Cost will start at the baseline vanilla value of 25, and quickly decrease over the first several levels as you progress. Only small improvements come at later levels. At level 10, the power will cost 15 points to cast, which lets you fire it 4 times in a row.\
\
Here are some charts to illustrate exactly how the magnitude and cost scale with each level of the power. Just like the other vanilla powers, this one now becomes more powerful and cheaper to cast as it levels up too.

## ![](https://i.ibb.co/5hv55GT/graphs.webp)[Fall Damage](https://)

Vanilla fall damage is very weak. Almost to the point of being irrelevant. You could blast someone off of a 4-story watch tower... and down the cliff beside it... on a 1.34 G planet... and they’ll only lose 3/4 of their health. Ask me how I know.\
\
I can’t just increase fall damage globally though. So with this mod, while an NPC is ragdolled by the Gravity Wave power specifically, fall damage is 1250% higher than default.\
\
Yes, I know that sounds insane. In practice though, it really isn’t. It’s balanced out so that blasting enemies off of high ledges is just about as lethal as it was in Skyrim, in a 1.0 G environment. They still have to hit the ground pretty hard to die from the impact though, so don’t worry about it being overpowered.\
\
Fall damage is NOT increased in any other case. Again, it is ONLY increased for NPCs while they are being ragdolled by this power specifically.

## ![](https://i.ibb.co/VDqBsZX/vanilla-vs-mod-falldamage.gif)[Smaller Things](https://)

This mod fixes an oversight which caused NPCs who are supposed to be immune from this power (such as Sam and Sarah) to still receive the slowdown and yell out in pain when hit by it. They will now fully resist the power, as they are supposed to. The slowdown itself has not been touched, and still works the same as it originally did on NPCs who don’t resist the power.\
\
This mod also adds a "casting effect" to this power, which looks like a white flash from your palm. Makes it look a bit more intense. Additionally, the sound becomes a bit more intense when the power is at level 5 or higher, to signify the increasing magnitude of the power.

## Features

> Use a remote control device to order your ship to take off, land, and set gravity.

<details><summary>CLICK FOR DETAILS</summary>
A **remote control** is added to your inventory with the following functions:

**Take off**- order ship to take off when it is landed.

- You can be inside or outside the ship.
- You can watch the ship take off from inside the cockpit.

**Land**- order the ship to land near you when it is in space.

- If you're within 200m of a (medium or large) landing pad or landing area, the ship will land there.
- Otherwise, the ship will check your position to see if there is a 60m x 60m relatively flat and level area for it to land on. Tolerance for flatness is 2 meters.
- An activity quest will tell you exactly where the ship will land.
- Beeg ships will probably clip.

**Set gravity**- set the ship's interior gravity (for what purpose? Who knows):

- 0.0g
- 0.1g
- 0.5g
- 1.0g

The **remote control** counts as a weapon, so you can:

- favorite item **favorite**.
- Give it a hotkey **hotkey**.

## Features

> Various ship modules provide extensive customization over ships ans ship building.

<details><summary>CLICK FOR DETAILS</summary>
### Tweaks&#x20;

- [TN's Hab Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/5732) - Rebalances the Habs added into the game by giving them small amounts of cargo (or large amounts for dedicated cargo habs), and other stats befitting the hab's purpose. Each Hab also grants the ship some amount of Hull based on size, instead of being a flat rate for all Habs.
- [TN's Useful Ship Structure](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/5836) - Gives all of the "decorative" structure items some Hull based on their size and a guestimate of how much 'armor' they would add to the ship. It also modifies some of the fuel tanks, landing gear, and dockers to give slightly more hull. Radiators give additional shield health, and the Sensors buff your lock on time slightly and to your crew station count (like weapons).
- [TN's Expanded Cargo Holds](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/5957) - Triples the cargo capacity of the cargo containers, though shielded cargo gives 85% of what unshielded does, instead of 75%. It also adds a little hull to the 'armored' cargo hulls, and gives additional storage in the captain's locker (plus makes it not respawn).
- [TN's Supplemental Thruster](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/5729) - Gives the braking thrusters, some of the landing gear, and maneuvering thrusters additional thrust and/or maneuvering at the cost of a small amount of power being diverted to them. The All in One also adds a little Hull where appropriate to bring it in line with the Useful Ship Structures.
- [TN's Supplemental Reactors](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/5962) - Adds additional "reactors" that can be used alongside primary reactors without the need to remove reactor limits. The mod is balanced so that it doesn't make the additional reactors add more hull, and instead costs the ship additional mass and lowered hull to get additional power.
- [TN's Supplemental Cockpits](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/6133) - Adds in copies of the primary cockpits with altered stats to act as decor and to grant additional crew stations, all without needing to remove the cockpit limit.
- [TN's Weapon To Module Snapping](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/6134) - Adds the ability to snap weapons (and other small modules like the scan jammers) onto any slot, even those directly on habs and on structure parts. It makes no edits to the weapons, habs, or structure parts themselves in order to achieve this.
- [TN's Separated Categories](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/7467) - Uses the [Ship Builder Categories](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/7310) mod to separate Habs into categories by manufacturer, weapons into categories by damage type, and the braking thrusters into their own category separate from structure parts.
- All of the above individual mods have been combined into one with minor edits for better compatibility between them.
- Supplemental Cockpits and Supplemental Reactors are now found in their own categories.
- This mod now requires the [Ship Builder Categories](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/7310) mod unless you use the "Less Dependencies Version". However it is highly recommended you get the Ship Builder Categories to avoid compatibility issues in the future.

## DLSS & Frame Generation (FG)

If you have an NVIDIA GPU you can take advantage of **DLSS**

## What settings should I use?

Below you will find the **DLSS** and **Frame Generation (FG)** options. These options are personal preference, just remember that once you start lowering the quality preset you will begin to see a loss in visual quality. Try to stick with the **"Quality"** or **"Ultra Quality"** for the best visual fidelity.
