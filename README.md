If you haven't seen me before that's because this is my first entry into the world of Bethesda but don't let that fool you I have a passion for everything Gaming/Modding. I have been modding and curating collections for other games such as [Hogwarts Legacy](https://next.nexusmods.com/hogwartslegacy/collections/uehwil?utm_source=copy\&utm_medium=social\&utm_campaign=share_collection) which I currently have the most endorsed and downloaded collection on [Nexus](https://). I've also curated the largest and most comprehensive mod collection for [Cyberpunk 2077](https://next.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/collections/dfvt7o?utm_source=copy\&utm_medium=social\&utm_campaign=share_collection) with 800+Mods.
