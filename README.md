![](https://s11.gifyu.com/images/S4CUN.jpg)Hey, Guys [v2](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/123334373) here this is [CONSTELLATION](https://) for **Starfield**.

<details><summary>ABOUT ME</summary>
Hey Chooms! My name is [v2](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/123334373) and i'm excited to meet you! I've fallen in love with Gaming and Modding and I'm sure you have too. Modding is really a cool way to add so much more to the games we already enjoy. But it's not always easy to get all those cool mods to work together with no issues. This inspired me to combine my passion for helping people, with a desire to make games that use mods, work as seamlessly as they can. I want it to be easier for you to jump right in, without having to worry if the mods will work. I curated a collection for [Hogwarts Legacy](https://next.nexusmods.com/hogwartslegacy/collections/uehwil?utm_source=copy\&utm_medium=social\&utm_campaign=share_collection) for example, and that has been the most endorsed and downloaded collection on Nexus! My [Cyberpunk 2077](https://next.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/collections/dfvt7o?utm_source=copy\&utm_medium=social\&utm_campaign=share_collection) collection is one of the most diversely comprehensive mod collections to date. Whether you love [Hogwarts](https://next.nexusmods.com/hogwartslegacy/collections/uehwil?utm_source=copy\&utm_medium=social\&utm_campaign=share_collection), [Cyberpunk](https://next.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/collections/dfvt7o?utm_source=copy\&utm_medium=social\&utm_campaign=share_collection), [Starfield](https://next.nexusmods.com/starfield/collections/npk3lv?utm_source=copy\&utm_medium=social\&utm_campaign=share_collection), or even [Elden Ring](https://next.nexusmods.com/eldenring/collections/qpwypd?utm_source=copy\&utm_medium=social\&utm_campaign=share_collection), I've got your back. And so does the community we've grown in my [Discord](https://discord.gg/xZNztPjA2u) when you have questions or just want to hangout with other like-minded gamers who want to get the most out of their games too!
</details>

<details><summary>MY VISION FOR THIS COLLECTION</summary>
My Vision for all my Collections is for you to be able to play the game any way you want. I won't force you to play a certain way I want you to have the tools to create your own experience so you can get the most out of your game.\
\
Constellation is the Ultimate experience you have access to everything you could ever need or want. Whether it's taking screenshots in photo mode, playing the most extreme difficulty, or cheating your way through Starfield this collection has it all and I mean all.\
\
And that's it I hope to see you in the Cosmos but now it's time for me to go.
